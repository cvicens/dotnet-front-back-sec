= Network policies

If a Pod is matched by selectors (`spec->podSelector`) in one or more NetworkPolicy objects, then the Pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those NetworkPolicy objects (`spec->ingress`). A Pod that is not selected by any NetworkPolicy objects is fully accessible.

This selects all pods...
